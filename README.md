The project will be a simulation of a car’s efficacy on a given F1 track, assuming perfect drivers are behind the wheel. The simulation will consider track grip (the static and non-static friction coefficients), the track’s effects on tire wear, car acceleration, car top speed, car down force, and car tire compound in these calculations. Simulations can be run with cars with preset statistics to see which cars in the current F1 season will likely win on a given track.
