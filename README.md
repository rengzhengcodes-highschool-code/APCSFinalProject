The project will be a simulation of car efficacy on a given track, assuming perfect drivers. The simulation will take into account track grip (the static and nonstatic friction coefficients), track tire wear, car acceleration, car top speed, car downforce, and car tire compound in these calculations. Simulations can be run with cars with preset statistics, so as to see which cars in the current F1 season will likely win on a given track.
